                The COVID-19 pandemic in India is a part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 17 August 2021, according to official figures, India has the second-highest
                number of confirmed cases in the world (after the United States) with 32.2 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and the third-highest number of COVID-19 deaths (after the United States and Brazil) at 432,079 deaths.However these
                figures exhibit severe under-reporting.<br><br></p>
            <p class="intro">
                The first cases of COVID-19 in India were reported on 30 January 2020 in three towns of Kerala, among three Indian medical students who had returned from Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic.Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in the rest
                of the country on 25 March. On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.Infection rates started to drop in September, along with the number of new and active cases.Daily cases peaked mid-September with over
                90,000 cases reported per-day, dropping to below 15,000 in January 2021.A second wave beginning in March 2021 was much more devastating than the first, with shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies
                in parts of the country.By late April, India led the world in new and active cases. On 30 April 2021, it became the first country to report over 400,000 new cases in a 24-hour period.Experts stated that the virus may reach an endemic stage
                in India rather than completely disappear; in late August 2021, Soumya Swaminathan said India may be in some stage of endemicity where the country learns to live with the virus.

                <h1><br>Impact of COVID-19 in India and the Global Economy</h1><br>
            </div>
            <hr class="second_hor">
            <p class="effect">
                As per the official government guidelines, India is making preparations against the COVID-19 outbreak, and avoiding specific crisis actions or not understating its importance will have extremely severe implications. All the neighboring countries of India
                have reported positive COVID-19 cases. To protect against the deadly virus, the Indian government have taken necessary and strict measures, including establishing health check posts between the national borders to test whether people entering
                the country have the virus . Different countries have introduced rescue efforts and surveillance measures for citizens wishing to return from China. The lesson learned from the SARS outbreak was first that the lack of clarity and information
                about SARS weakened China's global standing and hampered its economic growth. The outbreak of SARS in China was catastrophic and has led to changes in health care and medical systems . Compared with China, the ability of India to counter
                a pandemic seems to be much lower. A recent study reported that affected family members had not visit the Wuhan market in China, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may spread without manifesting symptoms. Researchers believe that this phenomenon
                is normal for many viruses. India, with a population of more than 1.34 billion—the second largest population in the world—will have difficulty treating severe COVID-19 cases because the country has only 49,000 ventilators, which is a minimal
                amount. If the number of COVID-19 cases increases in the nation, it would be a catastrophe for India. It would be difficult to identify sources of infection and those who come in contact with them. This would necessitate multiple strategies
                to handle the outbreak, including computational modeling as well as statistical and quantitative analyses, to rapidly develop new vaccines and drug treatments. With such a vast population, India's medical system is grossly inadequate.
                A study has shown that, owing to inadequate medical care systems, nearly 1 million people die every year in India. India is also engaged in trading with its nearby countries, such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, Myanmar, China, and Nepal.
                During the financial year 2017–18 (FY2017–18), Indian regional trade amounted to nearly $12 billion, accounting for only 1.56% of its total global trade value of $769 billion. The outbreak of such viruses and their transmission would significantly
                affect the Indian economy. The outbreak in China could profoundly affect the Indian economy, especially in the sectors of electronics, pharmaceuticals, and logistics operations, as trade ports with China are currently closed. This was
                further supported by the statement by Suyash Choudhary, Head—Fixed Income, IDFC AMC, stating that GDP might decrease owing to COVID-19.<br><br></p>
            <p class="effect">
                Economists assume that the impact of COVID-19 on the economy will be high and negative when compared with the SARS impact during 2003. For instance, it has been estimated that the number of tourists arriving in China was much higher than that of tourists
                who traveled during the season when SARS emerged in 2003. This shows that COVID-19 has an effect on the tourism industry. It has been estimated that, for SARS, there was a 57 and 45% decline in yearly rail passenger and road passenger
                traffic, respectively. Moreover, when compared with the world economy 15 years ago, world economies are currently much more inter-related. It has been estimated that COVID-19 will hurt emerging market currencies and also impact oil prices.
                From the retail industry's perspective, consumer savings seem to be high. This might have an adverse effect on consumption rates, as all supply chains are likely to be affected, which in turn would have its impact on supply when compared
                with the demand of various necessary product items . This clearly proves that, based on the estimated losses due to the effect of SARS on tourism (retail sales lost around USD 12–18 billion and USD 30–100 billion was lost at a global macroeconomic
                level), we cannot estimate the impact of COVID-19 at this point. This will be possible only when the spread of COVID-19 is fully controlled. Until that time, any estimates will be rather ambiguous and imprecise. The OECD Interim economic
                assessment has provided briefing reports highlighting the role of China in the global supply chain and commodity markets. Japan, South Korea, and Australia are the countries that are most susceptible to adverse effects, as they have close
                ties with China. It has been estimated that there has been a 20% decline in car sales, which was 10% of the monthly decline in China during January 2020. This shows that even industrial production has been affected by COVID-19. So far,
                several factors have thus been identified as having a major economic impact: labor mobility, lack of working hours, interruptions in the global supply chain, less consumption, and tourism, and less demand in the commodity market at a global
                level , which in turn need to be adequately analyzed by industry type. Corporate leaders need to prioritize the supply chain and product line economy trends via demand from the consumer end. Amidst several debates on sustainable economy
                before the COVID-19 impact, it has now been estimated that India's GDP by the International Monetary Fund has been cut down to 1.9% from 5.8% for the FY21. The financial crisis that has emerged owing to the worldwide lockdown reflects
                its adverse effect on several industries and the global supply chain, which has resulted in the GDP dropping to 4.2% for FY20, which was previously estimated at 4.8%. Nevertheless, it has been roughly estimated that India and China will
                be experiencing considerable positive growth among other major economies .

                <h1><br>Challenges Faced By The Doctors And Healthcare Workers</h1><br>
            </div>
            <hr class="third_hor">
            <p class="challenges">
                The violence against doctors and other medical personnel has increased over the past few decades, with up to 75% doctors facing this during their practice in India.8 Doctors attribute the surge in violence against healthcare workers to a mix of ignorance
                and fear, which is amplified by the pandemic.9 The lockdown has exacerbated the problem, with patients unable to access healthcare due to transport suspension, fear of law enforcement and frustration following quarantine or containment
                zone restrictions. The types of attacks have ranged from verbal abuse, verbal threats or aggressive gestures in majority of cases.10 However, there have also been serious reports of manhandling, abduction and murder.
                <br><br></p>
            <p class="challenges">
                The reasons for violence against healthcare workers may vary from fear, anxiety, panic, misinformation (as to how the SARS CoV-2 virus outbreak may spread and affect individuals), mistrust and misplaced quotes in the social-media.11 Government hospitals
                in India are inundated in such public health crisis with lack of adequate facilities, equipment and infrastructure are other quoted reasons. The private hospital sectors have largely shut down to non-emergency admissions, and people find
                it difficult to access medical aid. Aggressive emotional response of relatives may sometimes boil over with frustration exhibited in the form of damage to the healthcare facilities and verbal or physical violence against the healthcare
                personnel. The situation is being made more difficult as health units and professionals in some government hospitals highlight shortage of PPE but do receive hostile response from hostile hospital administration.9 Health professionals
                are recognised as ‘newer untouchables’. People are panicked about catching COVID-19 from medical workers or being stigmatised for having contracted it themselves.
